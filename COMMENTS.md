Please answer these questions once you have finished the assignment.

**What did you think of the assignment?**

Hello! =)
Well, it's a nice assignment...easy and beautiful, but, from another point of view, it's allowing to show some skills. Provided design was very helpful. I enjoyed doing this task, thank you for preparation this assignment!

I also want to mention, that I used two 3rd party libraries: redux and styled-components. Both of them just to show, that I know that technologies. For me, it will be not a problem to make this assignment without this libraries.

I, also added:
- Cute loader indicator =)
- Error message component
- Tests for redux slice and ProductCard component

Also, based on the design, I supposed, that separator in DatePicker component is showing before the start of the month...and that's how it works in my realization (instead of always show it after 3rd date button).

**Which part did you consider the most difficult, or did you spend most of your time on?**

I spent a lot of time for tests: I had problems with axios-mock-adapter, and it was not so easy to understand, how to mock IntersectionObserver. Also, it was hard to make a design, should I use redux or not.

**Which parts were you not able to fully implement?**

- No assessibility attributes (aria-label, title, etc...)
- No animation for lazy image loader (looks ugly, but...it's a test assignment...)
- Tests provided only for part of redux store, and only for one (the most complex) component

**What would you add or improve if you had more time?**

- Add animation for lazy image loader
- Add assessibility attributes (it's not hard, only time issue)
- Think more about proper HTML tags

**What would you do differently if it was a bigger application?**

- Use next framework instead of create-redux-app, or, at least, update all dependencies to latest versions
- More complex redux store, for example, loading flag should be not in one slice
- Think a bit more about components folders/architecture
- Add react router
- Fully cover code by tests & more complex tests
